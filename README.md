# ML-II
Project for the course Intelligent Data Analysis &amp; Machine Learning II
The objective here is to identify from a image that whether the person is wearing a mask or not. Data set has been taken from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashishjangra27/face-mask-12k-images-dataset?resource=download.

The goal is to create a convolutional neural networks that detect the presence of mask.
Models: 
* VGG16 from Keras
* Modified CNN taking inspiration from VGG16 Structure
